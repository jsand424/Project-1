Project Description/Outline:
Use road crash data from NSW government to draw insight from the following data sets. The aim of this project is to analyze the data collected from traffic cameras across New South Wales (NSW) to assess their impact on road safety, traffic management, and compliance with traffic laws. The project will utilize advanced data analytics techniques to provide actionable insights into how these cameras influence driving behavior and reduce incidents such as speeding, running red lights, and accidents.

Research Questions to Answer:

How can we reduce the amount of road crashes in New South Wales?

Rough Breakdown of Tasks: Answer the sub questions below through data visualisation

What is happening on the roads of Australia? 

What kind resalt do the traffic cameras give?

Does lighting lead to decrease in road crash?

Does higher speed limit lead to increase in road crash?

Do unsealed roads lead to more road crashes?

Which surface condition leads to more crashes?

Which weather led to the highest amount of crashes?

Do more crashes occur during the week or on weekends? What day of the week accounts for the most crashes?
